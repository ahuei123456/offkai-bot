## Motivation

Offkai Bot was created to streamline the process of attendance gathering for large group events, particularly for dinners after lives, concerts, and other gatherings.

This bot replaces manual methods of collecting attendance such as:
- Google Forms surveys
- Collecting reactions on Discord messages
- Manually tracking "I'm attending" replies

**Previous challenges solved:**
- ✅ Errors in keeping track of attendees
- ✅ Attendees missing important updates
- ✅ Manual data entry and collation
- ✅ No automated notification system
- ✅ Difficulty managing capacity limits and waitlists

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **📅 Event Management**
  - Create events with venue, address, Google Maps links, and deadlines
  - Set maximum capacity limits for events (with smart validation)
  - Modify event details including capacity (with safety checks)
  - Capacity increase allowed anytime, decrease only when safe
  - Cannot reduce capacity below current attendee count or with active waitlist
  - Open/close event registrations
  - Archive old events

- **👥 Attendance Tracking**
  - Interactive Discord buttons for attendance confirmation
  - Support for bringing extra people (+0 to +5 guests)
  - Behavior and arrival time confirmations
  - Optional drink preferences tracking
  - View current attendance count and attendee list

- **📋 Waitlist System**
  - Automatic waitlist when events reach capacity
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) promotion from waitlist
  - Batch promotion when multiple spots open up
  - Waitlist joins for groups that exceed remaining capacity
  - Join waitlist after registration deadline or when event is closed

- **🔔 Smart Notifications**
  - DM notifications for successful registrations (with responsibility warnings)
  - DM notifications when promoted from waitlist (with responsibility warnings)
  - DM notifications when withdrawing from events (with post-deadline warnings)
  - Fallback to ephemeral channel messages if DMs are disabled
  - Thread notifications when capacity is reached
  - Clear warnings about post-deadline withdrawal consequences

- **🎯 Registration Controls**
  - Prevent duplicate registrations (same user can't register twice for same event)
  - Cross-list duplicate prevention (can't be in both responses and waitlist)
  - Event isolation (registrations are per-event)
  - Withdrawal with automatic waitlist promotion
  - Withdrawal allowed even after event is closed or deadline passed
  - Post-deadline withdrawal warnings inform users of their responsibilities
  - Unified data structure with automatic migration from legacy format

- **💬 Communication Tools**
  - Broadcast messages to all event attendees
  - Thread-based event discussions
  - Automatic thread management (add/remove users)
  - Pin important event messages

- **🗑️ Management Commands**
  - Delete individual user responses
  - View drinks summary for catering
  - Archive completed events

### Data Architecture

- **Unified Storage Model**
  - Attendees and waitlist stored together in a single file per event
  - Each event contains separate `attendees` and `waitlist` arrays
  - Automatic migration from legacy separate-file format
  - Thread-safe operations with in-memory caching
  - JSON-based persistence for easy inspection and backup

- **Responsibility System**
  - All registrations include clear warnings about post-deadline withdrawals
  - Users informed of potential payment obligations and moderation consequences
  - Warnings shown at registration, waitlist join, and promotion
  - Post-deadline withdrawal messages emphasize user responsibility

## Prerequisites

Before running Offkai Bot, you need:

1. **Python 3.12 or higher**
   - Check your version: `python --version`

2. **uv (Python package manager)**
   - Install from: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
   - Or quick install: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

3. **Discord Bot Token**
   - Create a bot at: https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Enable required intents:
     - ✅ Server Members Intent
     - ✅ Message Content Intent (if using message features)
   - Copy the bot token for configuration

4. **Discord Server (Guild) ID**
   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode)
   - Right-click your server and select "Copy Server ID"

## How to Run

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd offkai-bot
   ```

2. **Verify uv is installed:**
   ```bash
   uv --version
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Create a `config.json` file in the project root:**

   ```json
   {
       "DISCORD_TOKEN": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
       "EVENTS_FILE": "data/events.json",
       "RESPONSES_FILE": "data/responses.json",
       "GUILDS": [
           123456789012345678
       ]
   }
   ```

2. **Configuration Fields:**

   | Field | Type | Required | Description |
   |-------|------|----------|-------------|
   | `DISCORD_TOKEN` | string | ✅ | Your Discord bot token. **Keep this secret!** |
   | `EVENTS_FILE` | string | ✅ | Path to events data file (e.g., `data/events.json`) |
   | `RESPONSES_FILE` | string | ✅ | Path to responses data file (includes both attendees and waitlist) |
   | `GUILDS` | array | ✅ | List of Discord server IDs where bot will be active |

   **Note:** The `WAITLIST_FILE` field is deprecated. Waitlist data is now stored in the responses file alongside attendee data. If you have an old `waitlist.json` file, it will be automatically migrated on first run.

3. **Data Directory:**

   The bot will automatically create the `data/` directory and JSON files if they don't exist.

### Running the Bot

**Basic command:**
```bash
uv run offkai-bot
```

```bash
uv run python -m offkai_bot.main
```
